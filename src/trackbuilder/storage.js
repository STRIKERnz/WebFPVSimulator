/*
 * storage.js: the track library in local storage, autosave, and the file
 * import and export.
 *
 * Two keys, both versioned, both namespaced under webfpv.trackbuilder so
 * nothing here can collide with the simulator's own settings key:
 *
 *   webfpv.trackbuilder.library.v1   every saved track, by id
 *   webfpv.trackbuilder.autosave.v1  the working track, whether saved or not
 *
 * The autosave is what makes a refresh safe. It is written on a short timer
 * after every edit rather than on every edit, because serialising a track on
 * each mouse move is the one place this tool could be made to feel slow.
 *
 * Every read goes through model.normalize, so a hand edited local storage
 * entry or a file from an older build cannot put the tool in a state it
 * cannot draw. Every write is wrapped, because private browsing throws on
 * localStorage.setItem and losing an autosave must never lose the session.
