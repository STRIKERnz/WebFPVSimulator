/*
 * faces.js: which way each element faces, and which side of a marker the
 * quad goes.
 *
 * This is the core of the tool, so the rules are written out rather than
 * inferred from the code.
 *
 * ENTRY FACE. Every aperture has a normal, fixed by the element's yaw and
 * pitch. A sequence entry carries `entry`, either +1 or -1, and the DIRECTION
 * OF TRAVEL through that opening is entry multiplied by the normal. So
 * entry = +1 means the quad flies along the normal and therefore enters the
 * opening from the face the normal points AWAY from. entry = 0 means nobody
 * has decided yet, and the results panel says so.
 *
 * PASS SIDE. A flag or a cone has no opening. `passSide` says which side of
 * the MARKER the QUAD passes on, in the frame of the direction of travel.
 * "left" means the quad is to the left of the marker, so the racing line is
 * pushed to marker + clearance * left. "right" is the mirror.
 *
 * AUTO DEFAULTING. The user should almost never have to set either. When an
 * element is placed, or when a neighbour moves, or when the sequence is
 * reordered, every entry that the user has NOT touched is re-derived from the
 * straight line between the previous and the next sequenced element:
 *
 *   an aperture element referenced ONCE in the sequence is rotated so its
 *   normal lies along that line, and its entry becomes +1;
 *   an aperture element referenced MORE THAN ONCE is not rotated, because
 *   rotating it for position 5 would break position 9, and only its entry
 *   sign is chosen from which way through it the line goes;
 *   a marker is put on the outside of the turn, which is the side a pilot
 *   actually flies.
 *
 * Touching a face by hand sets `overridden` on the sequence entry and
 * rotating an element by hand sets `yawOverridden` on the element. Either
 * flag stops the re-derivation dead for that item and the inspector says so.

 * The direction a quad flies through a hole is `entry` times the aperture

 * rotation is for.
 *
 * Measured on that course: gate 2 is flown three times, and a 360 degree
 * sweep in one degree steps reversed a pass without being asked to twenty
 * times. With the sign pinned it is zero, and the direction of travel tracks
 * the gate to within a thousandth of a degree the whole way round.
 *
 * IT PINS EVERY PASS, because a structure flown more than once has one frame

 * because it was not a bug in the handle. A marker's square was ALWAYS
 * square to the direction of travel, on one of exactly two sides, so the
 * only thing the rotation handle could reach was the flag's own mesh: the
 * pole turned, the sail swung round with it, and the green square did not
 * move a degree. There was nothing between "left" and "right".
 *
 * So the marker's OWN YAW is the offset direction once the author has
 * turned it by hand. yawOverridden is already the flag setYaw raises and
 * the flag "Re-derive" clears, and it already means exactly this
 * everywhere else: the author has decided, stop deriving. A turned flag
 * therefore puts its square wherever the handle points, all the way round,
 * and an untouched one keeps the automatic rule, which is the outside of
 * the turn and the thing an author should almost never have to set.
 *
 * IT IS PER ELEMENT, NOT PER PASS, and that is the same trade an aperture
 * makes: a structure flown twice has one frame, and turning the frame
 * turns both passes together. Steering one pass of a shared marker on its
 * own is what Flip side is for.
 *
 * `travel` is the local direction of travel, needed only for the automatic
