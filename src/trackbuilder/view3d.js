/*
 * view3d.js: the 3D view, the room every canvas is built in. Three.js, orbit, and the scene edit3d.js's gestures work on.
 *
 * THE Y UP CONVERSION HAPPENS ONCE, HERE, ON LINE ONE OF build(): the scene
 * root is rotated -90 degrees about X, which maps the document's right
 * handed Z up world onto Three.js's Y up scene. Every mesh below is built in
 * DOCUMENT coordinates and nothing else in this module or anywhere else in
 * the track builder converts a single axis. This is the same discipline
 * CLAUDE.md sets for the simulator's own render boundary, applied to the
 * builder's separate one. If a gate ever appears lying on its side, this
 * rotation is the only line that can be responsible.
 *
 * EVERY CANVAS IS BUILT IN THE ROOM: the whoop's, the five inch's and, since
 * FREESTYLE-3D-BUILD-PLAN.md, the map's. Its gestures are edit3d.js's (place
 * with a click and a ghost, pull a piece across the floor, turn it by the ring at
 * its foot, box select; on a map also lay a road and drop a car), and this file
 * draws what they need: the ghost, the ring, a translucent pane in every opening
 * in RaceGOW's own colour, an arrow through it, and the flying order's numbers
 * as HTML bubbles over the canvas so they stay one size and can be clicked. Drag
 * on empty space orbits, middle or right drag pans, the wheel zooms. What a
 * piece stands on, and so where a click puts it, is surfaceAt's.
 *
 * The scene is rebuilt wholesale whenever the document changes. A track is
 * tens of objects, not thousands, and a rebuild that cannot get out of step
 * with the document is worth more here than an incremental update that can.
 *
 * THREE.JS IS LOADED LAZILY, ON THE FIRST PRESS OF THE 3D BUTTON, and that is
 * not an optimisation. A static `import * as THREE from 'three'` here puts
 * the CDN on the critical path of the WHOLE TOOL: the browser fetches the
 * entire static module graph before a line of app.js runs, so a slow CDN
 * makes the 2D authoring view slow to appear and an unreachable one makes it
 * never appear at all. Measured on a network that could not reach jsdelivr,
 * that is exactly what happened: a blank page with no palette and no canvas,
 * for a view the author had not even asked for. The 2D view is the tool; the
 * 3D view is a preview, and a preview must not be able to take the tool down
 * with it. This mirrors what src/boot.js does for the simulator, for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * A FREESTYLE MAP IS DRAWN IN THE GAME'S OWN ART, so what is built is what is
 * flown. Its assets are drawn by the same src/props/kit.js the built map
 * draws with, lit by the town's lights under the town's sky, and put through
 * the town's ink and grade (src/maps/city/vendored/core/post.js). All of that
 * is fetched the same lazy way as Three.js and later still: only when the 3D
 * view opens on a freestyle document. A race or whoop document never loads a
 * line of it, and its scene is the race scene described above, untouched. The
 * freestyle half has its own scene with its own root, rotated by the same
 * one conversion; the kit's assets are Y up in their own frame, and the one
 * extra frame change that brings them into the document is written down
 * where it happens, in buildAsset().
 *
 * A MAP'S ROADS AND CARS are drawn by the simulator's own
 * src/maps/built/roadmesh.js and cars.js, from trafficOf, fetched with the
 * cel kit, and the cars stand where they start. PLAY drives them: the
 * first press fetches the physics module (dist/sim.wasm, through the
 * loader the shell uses), hands it the map's traffic, and from then on
 * every car is drawn where the module says it is at the clock, the
 * milliseconds since Play was pressed. Stop puts them back. The frame
 * change they need and the clock are written down in buildTraffic() and
 * poseTraffic().
