/*
 * view2d.js: the top down authoring view. Plain Canvas2D, no library.
 *
 * This is where a track is built, so everything that edits lives here:
 * place, select, box select, move, rotate, flip, delete, pan, zoom. The 3D
 * view is a preview and does almost none of it.
 *
 * THE PLAN PROJECTION IS THE WHOLE TRICK. Every aperture is drawn as its
 * four corners flattened onto the ground, which means a vertical gate
 * collapses to a bar and a horizontal dive gate opens out into a rectangle,
 * without a single special case in the drawing code. That is exactly the
 * distinction the task asks the 2D view to make obvious, and it falls out of
 * the geometry instead of being asserted by a flag.
 *
 * Screen mapping: +X to the right, +Y UP THE SCREEN, which is what makes the
 * top down view a right handed frame seen from above and makes a left turn
 * on the field a left turn on the screen. Getting this backwards is how a
 * course ends up mirrored.
