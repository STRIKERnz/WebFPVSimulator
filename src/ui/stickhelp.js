/*
 * stickhelp.js: what the Stick help screen says, and where a stick that
 * does nothing is being lost.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The owner, 28 September 2026: the board kept getting
 * tickets saying a controller could not yaw, or pitch, or throttle, and
 * nothing in any of them could say whether the pilot's radio was set up
 * wrong or the sim was. Read against the reports' own context, the answer
 * was mostly neither:
 *
 *   phones      nine tickets, every one about yaw or throttle. Chrome on
 *               Android hands a page four axes from a radio it does not
 *               recognise and drops the rest, and a radio in AETR order
 *               puts throttle and yaw on the two axes that compete for one
 *               of the four. No calibration anywhere can bring a dropped
 *               axis back. See fourAxisPad in src/input/input.js.
 *   Firefox     both Linux tickets. It calls an EdgeTX radio a gamepad and
 *               moves its axes. See firefoxRadio in src/input/input.js.
 *   desktops    mostly a radio flown on the built in guess of the channel
 *               order, which the wizard fixes in a minute.
 *   Safari      a radio never seen at all. Every WebKit ticket on the board
 *               reads the keyboard and 0 Hz, and the pilots who had a radio
 *               plugged in were told to swap cables. See radioBlind.
 *
 * So the screen does not start with instructions. It starts with the one
 * question that splits every cause into two piles, asked while the pilot's
 * hand is on the stick: move the stick that is not working, does any bar
 * move? If one does, the browser has it and the sim is reading it wrong,
 * and the wizard fixes that. If none does, the stick never reached the
 * browser, nothing in any page can fix it, and what can is the radio, the
 * operating system or the browser, which is what the block under the bars
 * says for the platform the pilot is on.
 *
 * Plain functions of plain data, so scripts/input-selftest.js can read every
 * sentence without a browser. The DOM is src/ui/ui.js's; the axes are
 * input.js's stickCheckView.

/*
 * A BROWSER THAT DOES NOT SHOW A RADIO TO A PAGE, and what to say when the
 * pilot has come here to fly with one.
 *
 * bug-616cc604, 29 September, Safari 27: a Radiomaster Pocket that neither a
 * MacBook Air nor an iPad showed to the sim, and "I've tried several USB-C to
 * USB-C cables and even my USB-C hub to a USB-A to USB-C cable". Everything
 * the sim said had sent them to do exactly that. "No radio or gamepad found.
 * Plug one in, set it to joystick mode" is right for a radio in the wrong
 * mode, and on Safari it sent a pilot off to swap cables that could not
 * matter. The title and the pause menu said nothing at all, because their
 * trouble rows only exist once a pad has reached the sim.
 *
 * WHAT IS KNOWN. Of the 200 tickets on the board that day, eight came from
 * WebKit: four Safari on a Mac and four on an iPhone or iPad, where every
 * browser is WebKit underneath. All eight read `source` the keyboard and
 * `padHz` 0. Three of the Mac ones were about a radio (bug-c3ecb273,
 * bug-7d3064fc, bug-616cc604, on Safari 26.5, 26.6.2 and 27.0) and so was
 * the iPad's bug-40980a75, and not one of the four was ever shown a pad. The
 * same board holds 22 tickets from Chrome and Firefox on Macs that flew a
 * pad or a radio. That evidence is one sided, since a pilot whose radio works
 * has no reason to file a ticket, but the flight feel tickets come from
 * exactly those pilots and none of them is a Safari radio.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT. Why. On an iPhone or iPad the GameController framework is the
 * only source of pads and it lists the controllers Apple knows, which a USB
 * radio is not. On a Mac WebKit has a generic HID reader beside that one, so
 * "Safari only shows controllers it knows" is NOT a reason this file can give
 * for a Mac, and it does not. Nobody on this project has had a radio in
 * Safari to try. So the Mac words say what has been seen ("usually cannot")
 * and ask for the one test that settles it for the pilot in front of the
 * screen: the same radio, plugged in the same way, in Chrome, Edge or
 * Firefox. A report now carries what the browser listed (browserPads in
 * src/input/input.js), so the next Safari ticket says whether it listed
 * anything at all.
 *
 * One entry per surface, because the surfaces have different room: the
 * banner over a flight, the help column beside a menu row, a row of the
 * How to fly screen, the sentence under Stick help's bars, and its block for
 * when no bar moves. Null for every other browser, whose surfaces keep their
 * own words.

 *
 * THE ANDROID PARAGRAPHS ARE WORKED OUT FROM BOTH ENDS' CODE, NOT TRIED.
 *
 * Chrome's fallback for a pad it does not know (GamepadMappings.java,
 * UnknownGamepadMappings, the legacy branch: "only the canonical axes are
 * exposed ... and unmatched input axes are dropped") keeps X and Y, one of Z
 * and Rx, and one of Ry and Rz. EdgeTX in its ordinary joystick mode sends
 * channels 1 to 8 on X, Y, Z, Rx, Ry, Rz, Slider and Dial, in that order
 * (usb_driver.cpp fills axis i from channel i + 1), and OpenTX, which EdgeTX
 * came from, does the same. So a phone gets channels 1 and 2, one of 3 and
 * 4, and one of 5 and 6, and on an AETR radio that is one of throttle and yaw
 * gone. Five tickets on 29 and 30 September, five radios from three makers
 * (bug-8acd3b2f, bug-abaabdde, bug-b2de5239, bug-da8c8d0e, bug-f42ae325), all
 * arrived as 4 axes and 17 buttons with axis 2 resting at the throttle's end:
 * Z kept, Rx and yaw dropped.
 *
 * The fix this used to give was a computer, or EdgeTX's Advanced mode with
 * the four sticks on X, Y, Z and rotZ. That is right, and it is no help on
 * OpenTX, which has no such mode. Mixing the missing stick onto channels 5
 * AND 6 works on both, in the joystick mode they are already in: Chrome keeps
 * one of the two, so the stick arrives on it whichever that is, and on a
 * radio that lost yaw the four axes are then roll, pitch, throttle and yaw,
 * the order this page guesses. Nobody has flown it on a phone yet, so the
 * copy says so and asks to be told. A copy of the model, because channel 5
 * is often the arm switch on the model that flies a real quad. And CLEAR the
 * two channels rather than add to them: a line added under an arm switch's
 * line sums with it by default, and the stick would arrive offset by the
 * switch and clipped at one end.
 *
 * Chrome has a newer mapping behind a flag (ANDROID_UNKNOWN_GAMEPAD_EXTRA_
 * AXES) that keeps the rest as extra axes. Under it a radio arrives with
 * more than four axes, fourAxisPad is false, and none of this is shown.
