/*
 * place.js: a freestyle map document, placed in the world. Pure: no
 * Three.js, no DOM, no JS trigonometry.
 *
 * Everything a built map needs to know about where things are comes out of
 * here: each element's world position and heading, the solids the physics
 * will hold, the named gaps, and where the pilot starts. The map
 * (./index.js) draws what this places; the track builder's warnings and
 * scripts/props-check.js read the same answer in Node. One function, so the
 * three cannot disagree about where a building is.
 *
 * THE FRAMES. The document is right handed, Z up, origin at the plot's near
 * left corner (src/trackbuilder/schema.md). The world is Three.js metres, Y
 * up, origin at the plot's middle. The conversion is the one
 * src/game/trackdoc.js makes for race tracks, applied here once, in
 * docToWorld:
 *
 *   worldX =  docX - width / 2
 *   worldZ = -(docY - depth / 2)
 *   worldY =  docZ                  the ground is flat, at 0
 *
 * A document yaw is a heading about up, counter clockwise from +x seen from
 * above, and that is exactly Object3D.rotation.y in the world, because the
 * document's +y is the world's -z. An aperture's yaw is its plane normal,
 * and src/props/course.js builds gates with their normal on local +x, so it
 * takes the same number. A heading an asset cannot hold (a building at 40
 * degrees) is snapped by src/props/solids.js placedYaw, for the solids AND
 * the drawing.

 * THE GROUND UNDER A POINT: the highest solid box top whose plan footprint

 * path: the shell asks it for the plane it hands the plant on every 1 ms
 * step, five more times every eight steps for the slope, and for the spawn
 * seat. Plain comparisons only.
 *
 * The reach is the town's, 0.55 m (heightAt in
 * src/maps/city/vendored/world/index.js, restated in
 * src/maps/city/cavity.js), restated here because importing either would
 * drag the town into the builder. It is what lets a craft fly UNDER a deck
 * and land ON it: the shell asks from 0.40 m under the CG (SURFACE_BIAS in
 * src/main.js), so a top is in reach up to 0.15 m OVER the CG. The town's
 * decks are thick, and their underside stops a craft long before that. A
 * built map's are not: a scaffold board is 5 cm, an open container's roof
 * 10 cm, and a craft climbing under one had its top handed to it as the
 * ground and was lifted up through it in one step, with no contact. So the
 * shell also passes the CG, cgY, and a box whose bottom is over the CG is
 * over the craft and is never its ground, however thin. Omit cgY and no
 * box is left out for that (the spawn seat, the obstacles, the intro
 * camera ask with a fromY that is not a craft's). Omit fromY as well and
 * every top counts, as in the town.
 *
 * The footprint test is strict, the way the plant's own support test is
 * (world_select_support in src/native/world.c): a point on a box's edge is
 * not over it. Only boxes: a capsule is a pole, a bar or a lattice member,

/*
 * WHERE A PILOT WITH NO START PADS STARTS: in the open, as near as the map
 * allows to the point eight metres in from the plot's west edge on its
 * middle line, facing across the plot.
 *
 * That point used to be the start whatever stood on it. A pilot, on 28
 * September 2026: "it spawns me inside a pylon i can't get out". A pylon
 * over the point is the case nothing caught, because the builder's metre
 * of air (fs-spawn in src/trackbuilder/warnings.js) is measured from the
 * craft to its nearest solid, and a pylon's legs and braces are all further
 * off than that: the craft sat in the middle of the lattice, 3.26 m from
 * its nearest member, with the peak over it, and the builder said nothing.
 * A building or a stack of containers over the point started the craft
 * inside the solid, which the builder did warn about, and the simulator
 * started it there anyway. The owner, the same day: "no matter the map
 * someone builds, the quad has to spawn in open space, unless they build
 * launch pads then from the launch pads". So the point is only where the
 * search starts, and pads are spawnFrom's, below, wherever they stand.
 *
 * OPEN is three things, all measured in plan:
 *
 *   nothing solid within OPEN_CLEAR of the craft's centre across the
 *     ground, at ANY height over the paving. That is a metre of air round
 *     the craft and open sky over it, so a craft that climbs straight up
 *     meets nothing: under a pylon's peak, a crane's jib, a tree's canopy
 *     or a footbridge's deck is not open, however much air there is at the
 *     craft's own height. It also puts the craft on the paving, since a
 *     spot a metre clear of every box has no box under it;
 *   no road within a car's reach of it and OPEN_CLEAR more, because a car
 *     would drive through a craft waiting there, which is the owner's rule
 *     for where a crash is set down (findRestSpot in src/game/collide.js,
 *     2026-09-26) and rd-start's in the builder;
 *   on the plot, OPEN_CLEAR in from its edge.
 *
 * THE SEARCH walks a lattice OPEN_STEP apart round the point, nearest
 * first, and the first open spot is the start. Nearest is counted in whole
 * lattice steps squared, which are integers and so exact, and a tie goes
 * east, the way the craft faces, then north. The point itself is asked
 * first, against every solid in turn, because most maps leave it open and
 * those pay for one walk of the list and nothing else: the start is then
 * the one this function always gave, to the bit. When the plot has no open
 * ground at all (a small plot with a big thing on it), the start is the
 * nearest open ground off its edge, up to OPEN_OFF out, facing into it.
 * When there is none there either, it is the point, on whatever is laid
 * there, as it always was, and fs-spawn says what that is inside.
 *
 * ARITHMETIC ONLY, like the rest of this file: every distance is compared
 * squared, the roads are ./road.js's lines, which keep the same rule, and
 * the heading is a quarter turn written as the constant. So the start the
 * plant's frame is seated at is the same bits in every engine.
 *
 * `from` on the spawn says which start it is, for the builder's note
 * (fs-no-start): 'pads' (spawnFrom), 'point', 'open', 'off' or 'blocked'.

 * were raised onto, or the paving when they were raised over nothing. The
 * builder warns when the two differ (fs-pads-seat in
