/*
 * built/index.js: a freestyle map somebody built in the track builder, as a
 * world to fly.
 *
 * WHICH MAP. One injected by the caller (options.document), otherwise the
 * one open on the builder's freestyle canvas, otherwise Hibari Yard, the
 * starter (./starter.js). A document that is not a freestyle map is never
 * built here: a race track in the freestyle seat is somebody else's mistake
 * and flying it as a map would put gates in a yard with no course through
 * them. An empty freestyle canvas is not flown either, because a paved
 * plot with nothing on it is a worse first flight than the starter, and the
 * builder is one row away on the Freestyle screen.
 *
 * WHAT IS OURS AND WHAT IS THE TOWN'S. The look is the town's, reproduced
 * from src/maps/city/index.js rather than imported from it: the same fog
 * colour, the same four lights at the same offsets, the same painted sky and
 * ridge lines (closed into rings round the plot, see buildBackdrop), the
 * same post chain with the same shared renderer fixes. The assets are
 * src/props, drawn by src/props/kit.js in the town's cel materials. What
 * is this file's own is the ground (a plot, not a town), how far the fog
 * lets a pilot see (see fogFor), the wires between poles and pylons, the
 * lamps' glow at dusk, and the title camera's orbit.
 *
 * A MAP HAS A TIME OF DAY AND A GROUND (the document's scene, see
 * ./looks.js). Golden hour over concrete is the town's light on a concrete
 * yard, number for number what this map was before scenes existed; the
 * other times repaint the same lights, sky, fog and grade from ./looks.js,
 * and the other grounds are painted here, each in the yard's manner.
 *
 * THE SOLIDS COME FROM ONE PLACE. src/maps/built/place.js places the
 * document and says what is solid; this file puts exactly that into a
 * Colliders and hands it to the shell, which uploads it to the plant. The
 * builder's warnings read the same placement, so the map and the editor
 * cannot disagree about where a wall is. The paving is flat and at zero,
 * and `height` is the top of the box under a point, when there is one
 * within a step of the query (groundUnder in ./place.js), so the shell
 * seats, measures and sets a craft down on a roof as the plant already
 * stands it on one.
 *
 * EVERY MAP CARRIES THE STF MARK (FREESTYLE-MAPS-PLAN.md section 9), and
 * the author does not choose where: ./egg.js chooses from the placed map,
 * this file paints it there (paintStfMark) and hands the shell where it is
 * as `egg`. It is paint, so no solid comes of it. The builder imports
 * neither this file nor ./egg.js, so it never shows where the mark will be:
 * the person who built a map sees it from the pads when they fly it, like
 * everybody else. The partners' marks (src/partners/roster.js) come the
 * same way, one each, on walls ./egg.js chooses after the STF mark's
 * (choosePartnerSpots), painted by paintPartnerMarks and handed over as
 * `marks`.
 *
 * THE CARS MOVE, AND NOTHING ELSE DOES. A map's roads and vehicles
 * (./traffic.js) are drawn by ./roadmesh.js and ./cars.js, and the physics
 * module drives the cars: the shell uploads the traffic this file hands it,
 * reads every car's pose after it steps, and gives them back to poseCars to
 * draw. So updateAnim is still a no op, and the per frame work is that,
 * seating the lights, trailing the sky and switching chunks on and off by
 * distance.

 * of the starter's plot in view it costs 350 to 540 draw calls on High and
 * 120 to 400 on Low, shadow pass included (measured with __budget from the
 * spawn and three cameras over the plot).
 *
 * So the fog is sized to the plot. It starts at FOG_NEAR and on High ends
 * at 1.2 times the plot's diagonal, held between 180 m, so a small plot
 * still has a horizon rather than a hard edge, and 420 m, inside the sky
 * dome. three.js fades fog on a smoothstep, so on the starter's plot the
 * far end, 160 m from the spawn, is about half fogged and reads, and only
 * the far corner is lost in it. Medium and Low end it sooner: with the cull
 * radius tied to the fog, a big plot's far chunks switch off sooner, and

 * THE INK, WITH ONE CHANGE: THE SECOND DIFFERENCE IS TAKEN OF INVERSE DEPTH.
 *
 * The town's ink pass inks where the second difference of LINEAR depth,
 * over depth, passes a threshold. On a plane seen at a slant that quantity
 * is not zero: linear depth along the screen goes as one over the distance
 * from the horizon, so its second difference grows as the square of the
 * range. A town hides that behind its buildings. A yard is one flat plane
 * out to the kerb, and a pilot flying at two metres saw it as a band of ink
 * twenty pixels deep along the whole horizon, from about 20 m out to the
 * 98 m where the pass fades.
 *
 * Inverse depth is exactly linear across any plane in screen space, so its
 * second difference is zero on every flat surface at every angle, and to
 * first order it is the same number as the town's at a crease or an edge:
 * with dl = dc (1 + a) and dr = dc (1 + b) the town's term is a + b and this
 * one is a + b - a^2 - b^2 to second order. On a plane a is about -b and
 * the town's term comes to about 2 a^2, which is exactly what the squares
 * take away. Same sign, same thresholds, so every line the town draws on an
 * asset is drawn here, and the ground stops drawing one on itself.
 *
 * Done on this pipeline's own copy of the material, by replacing the two
 * lines, so ./vendored/core/post.js stays byte identical to upstream. If a
 * vendored update ever changes those lines the replacement finds nothing,
 * the town's ink runs unchanged, and `inkPlanar` in stats() says so.
