/*
 * catalog.js: every asset a built freestyle map can hold, with the code
 * that lays it out and the code that paints it.
 *
 * What each asset IS lives in ./types.js, which imports nothing, so the
 * track builder can list the assets without this file. This file adds the
 * two functions per asset:
 *
 *   layout(el) -> parts          pure: what is solid (./parts.js)
 *   draw(el, parts, kit)         the paint on top, in the browser only;
 *                                `kit` is src/props/kit.js and carries
 *                                Three.js, so nothing here imports it
 *
 * The map reads this to build the world, the builder's 3D preview reads it
 * to draw the same world, and the checks read it to prove every asset is
 * drawn and solid. One table, so the three cannot disagree.
