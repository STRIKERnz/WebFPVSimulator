/*
 * types.js: what each freestyle asset IS, as plain data. Imports nothing.
 *
 * Split out of ./catalog.js so the track builder's src/trackbuilder/
 * elements.js can list the assets without pulling in their layouts. The
 * layouts import the builder's pure modules for the gate furniture, so a
 * table that held both would be an import cycle, and a cycle in an ES module
 * graph is a table that is sometimes undefined depending on which file was
 * asked for first. A leaf cannot be in a cycle.
 *
 * AN ENTRY:
 *
 *   id        the document's `type`
 *   label     what the palette says
 *   key       its hotkey on the freestyle palette, or '' for none
 *   group     which palette heading it sits under
 *   turns     'any'      built of capsules, faces any heading
 *             'quarter'  has boxes, keeps to the four compass headings
 *                        until the physics learns turned boxes
 *                        (FREESTYLE-MAPS-PLAN.md, P1)
 *   dims      default dimensions, copied into a new element
 *   limits    { key: [min, max, kind] }: 'm' a length, 'int' a count,
 *             'frac' a fraction, 'x' a multiplier
 *   labels    what the inspector calls each dimension
 *   styles    optional list of looks; the first is the default
 *   note      one line for the palette's tooltip and the inspector
 *   zone      true for a scoring zone: never solid, never drawn in the air
 *   tilt      'quarter' for an asset that may stand on its end: the element's
 *             `pitch` is then 0 (upright) or +-90 degrees (on end), and
 *             tiltOf below says which. A box turned a quarter about a
 *             horizontal axis is still an axis aligned box, which is the
 *             whole of why this needs no change to the physics. An asset
 *             without it ignores `pitch`, as every asset always has.

 * turn apart, so the one nearest straight up is at most a sixth of a turn off
 * it, and which one is `spin`'s doing. The blade is held to what the hub's
 * height leaves it (the layout keeps its lowest tip 2.5 m up), which is
 * counted here without the hub's own reach, so it can only be generous. A
 * tip is at most 1.1 m further from the hub than the blade is long (its root
 * starts inside the hub), and it ends in a flat end at most 0.22 m round
 * (tipR in ./industrial.js), whose rim on a blade leaning `off` from straight
 * up stands r * sin(off) over the tip: counted as 0.25, because leaving it
 * out put this 11 cm under the drawn tip of a 60 m blade at Rotor 0.5. The
 * nacelle's roof and lamp stand at most 3 m over the hub's height. This is
 * the builder's readout and never the physics' path, so the cosine and the
 * sine are the engine's.
