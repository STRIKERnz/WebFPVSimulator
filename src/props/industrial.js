/*
 * industrial.js: the tall things. A tower crane, a water tower, a lattice
 * mast, a chimney, a power pylon, a stack of containers and a scaffold.
 *
 * WHY MOST OF THESE TURN FREELY. A lattice is made of members, and a member
 * is a capsule, and a capsule has no heading for the physics to care about.
 * So the crane, the water tower, the mast, the chimney and the pylon are
 * built out of nothing but capsules and face any way the author points them.
 * The containers and the scaffold have flat decks you land on, and a deck is
 * a box, so they keep to the four compass headings until the physics learns
 * turned boxes (FREESTYLE-MAPS-PLAN.md, P1).
 *
 * THE LATTICE IS SOLID, every member of it, and that is deliberate: what a
 * pilot sees is what a pilot hits. Where a lattice is a line to be flown
 * through (the crane's mast, the jib, the pylon's lower body) its openings
 * keep the gap rule of ./parts.js, which is what sets the sizes below: a
 * 2.4 m crane mast with panels of at least 3.2 m leaves a clear circle of
 * about 1.45 m in every triangle, and the jib is braced as a Warren truss
 * (diagonals, no verticals) because the right triangles that verticals cut
 * it into would be about 1.2 m, a slot rather than a line.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT SOLID: wires and fittings a few centimetres thick, ladders,
 * signs, lamps, gratings, and the debris net's weave. A chunky shape that
 * cannot be a capsule (a cab, a counterweight, a hook block, a radome) is
 * drawn as what it is and made solid as capsules that sit inside it, at most
 * a few tenths of a metre shy of the drawn corners. The solid is never
 * outside the drawing: nothing here is an invisible wall.
 *
 * THE LOOK is the town's: cel materials with violet shadows, and enough real
 * detail (sheaves, hoops, corrugation, planks, bolted flanges) that the
 * screen space ink has edges to draw when the pilot is close, while the
 * silhouette alone carries the read at forty metres. Thin members that
 * would shrink below a pixel at that range (hoist ropes, pendants) are drawn
 * a little thicker than life, and their solids match what is drawn.

   * metre under the drawn top it reaches. What shows above its drawn foot
   * is a low arch, widest at that foot and never wider than the drawing
   * there (the pad's 0.53 m either side of its axis at the ground, the
   * frame's 0.44 m at the pad's top, and 0.66 m at the ground, inside the
   * pad), so the solid is never outside what is drawn. The axes are close
   * enough that the dip between two is 3 cm: a surface to stand on, and no
   * groove to find. At the frame bar the base frame's solid stands 0.2 m
   * up, over the bar's underside, so the slot is shut.
   *
   * An arch comes down to nothing at its edge, which left a craft set down
   * beside the pad with a prop 10 cm over the drawn edge, so the pad has a
   * kerb as well: a capsule as thick as the pad along each edge, touching
   * the drawn face at mid height and inside it everywhere else.

 * THE HOLLOW CHIMNEY. A brick stack you can fly down: open at the top, with
 * a doorway in its foot on the side it faces, so a pilot dives in over the
 * rim, drops the length of the bore and goes out through the door. A map
 * builder asked for exactly that on 1 October 2026 (bug-e605ff6a, "hollow
 * chimneys with opening in the bottom to dive through").
 *
 * THE WALL IS STAVES. The chimney above is solid and its shaft is one
 * capsule on the axis; this one is a ring of capsules that lean with the
 * taper, each as thick as the wall (a stave's diameter is the brick's
 * thickness: 45 cm on the smallest stack, 80 on the biggest), as many round
 * as keeps the groove between two within 4 cm, which is what the chimney's
 * own staves keep. Nothing is across the middle: the bore is clear from the
 * rim to the ground, and the drawing leaves it open too (K.shell has no
 * caps, where K.cyl has a ceiling at each end).
 *
 * THE DOORWAY IS WHAT IS LEFT OUT. Stave 0 is the middle of it, on the
 * heading, and the staves round it that would stand in it are cut short to
 * stand only over the door, from its lintel to the rim. Its two edges are
 * jamb columns, one more capsule each, set at the exact angle that leaves
 * the width asked for between them, and they are DRAWN as what they are: the
 * door's edges are round columns, so what is solid there is what is drawn,
 * and no flat reveal stands up to 20 cm proud of a round solid at its
 * corners. A jamb that sat on the ring of staves would quantize the width in
 * steps of half a metre, which is not what a field called Doorway says. The
 * width is the clear between the jambs at the top of the door, where the
 * wall has leaned in furthest. Its height is half as much again, and never
 * over half the stack. It opens at most 75 degrees either side of the
 * heading: past that the back of the wall is too short to be one, so a
 * doorway is never wider than the bore. src/props/types.js holds the field
 * to a radius and a quarter, which that stop never reaches.
 *
 * THE RIM AND THE LINTEL are the staves' own domes. The drawing rolls a
 * bullnose over them (K.rim, round the top, and between the jambs under the
 * wall over the door), so a craft that lands on the rim or grazes the lintel
 * meets what is drawn: a flat underside over round solids stood up to 17 cm
 * proud of them at its corners, which the first version of this had.
 *
 * ONE SPEC, TWO READERS. hollowShape is what the layout builds from and what
 * the drawing paints from, and what scripts/props-check.js measures, so the
 * three cannot disagree about where the brick is.

 * THE WIND TURBINE. A tapering white tower, a nacelle and a hub on it, and

 * does not turn. A map builder asked for wind turbines on 1 October 2026
 * (bug-e605ff6a).
 *
 * WHY THE BLADES STAND STILL. The module holds a world that does not move:
 * its shapes are fixed for the life of the map, and a rotor that turned
 * would be drawn in one place and solid in another. So a blade is where
 * Rotor puts it (0 to 1 is a third of a turn, which is all the rotor has,
 * three blades being alike), and a pilot who wants a line between two blades
 * turns the rotor until there is one. A turning rotor is a different thing,
 * a mover the physics would have to be taught, and is not built here.
 *
 * ALL CAPSULES, SO IT FACES ANY HEADING. The tower and every blade are cones,
 * and a cone is capsules chained along its axis (coneChain), each as thick as
 * the cone is at its far end, so the solid is never outside what is drawn.
 * The nacelle and the hub are single capsules drawn as themselves. The blades
 * are round in section, as the tower is, and not the flat airfoils of a real
 * one: a flat blade is a row of capsules across its width at every step along
 * it, hundreds of them to a rotor, to get a shape that is 30 cm thick.
 *
 * THE GAP RULE. A blade pointing straight down runs parallel to the tower, so
 * the rotor stands far enough ahead of the tower that the clear between them
 * is 1.5 m at the root and more along it, and the blade is held to what the
 * hub's height leaves it, its lowest tip 2.5 m over the ground.
