/*
 * kit.js: turn freestyle assets into meshes, in the town's cel style, in as
 * few draw calls as the materials allow.
 *
 * Every asset in src/props is a layout (what is solid, pure data) and a draw
 * (the paint on top). This is the only file that knows about Three.js: it
 * draws each part the layout marked as drawn, hands itself to the asset's
 * draw() as `K`, and collects everything into one batch per material, so a
 * map of two hundred assets is a few dozen draw calls rather than tens of
 * thousands. The builder's 3D preview and the sim's built map both draw
 * through here, which is what makes the preview the game.
 *
 * THE MATERIALS ARE THE TOWN'S: cel() and flat() from the vendored toon kit,
 * out of its palette, tinted its cool violet in shadow. A few colours the
 * town has no use for (a crane's yellow, a container's red, a scaffold's
 * galvanising) are added, each pulled toward the town's range the way
 * src/maps/city/places/kit.js pulls its rust and tile, so a crane beside a
 * house looks as if one artist drew both.
 *
 * The town's own vending machines are drawn by the vendored builder, and
 * its cars by src/art/cars.js, the model the town itself now draws them
 * with; their meshes are folded into the same batches.
