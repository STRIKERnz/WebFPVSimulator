/*
 * roster.js: the partners, and the one list all three repositories read.
 *
 * WHO. Three businesses and a club back WebFPV, each exclusive in its kind:
 * Global Drone Solutions as the official training partner, Mantis FPV as the
 * official retail partner, and the West Coast Multirotor Club as the official
 * club partner. The owner named them on 2026-09-27 and approved the plan that
 * puts them on the front door, on Tracks and Times, on a partners page with a
 * dashboard for each of them, and painted into every freestyle map.
 *
 * WHY ONE LIST, AND WHY HERE. The front door draws their marks, the board
 * prints their cards and counts what they are owed, and the simulator paints
 * them into its maps. Three copies of a name, a link or a slug would drift the
 * first time one of them changed. This repository is the copy of record for
 * anything the three share, so the list lives here and is copied byte for
 * byte into the other two by their own scripts/vendor.js, the way
 * src/ui/lettering.js already is. A change is made here and copied again.
 *
 * WHAT A PARTNER IS, field by field:
 *
 *   slug    what travels in links, counters and stamps. The board's
 *           SOURCE_RE shape (src/sponsors.js there), so a partner's tracking
 *           link `?utm_source=<slug>` counts as theirs. It never changes once
 *           published: a poster with the link on it cannot be reprinted.
 *   name    the name as the partner writes it.
 *   short   the name where there is room for little: a find callout lettered
 *           over the flying, a table column.
 *   role    'training', 'retail' or 'club'. ROLE_TITLES says it in words.
 *   about   what they do, in a sentence or two, for their card on the
 *           partners page. DRAFTS, and each partner signs off their own
 *           before the page ships. THE RULE FOR THEM: say only what the
 *           partner says about themselves on their own site. Checked line
 *           by line against those sites on 2026-09-27, which took out
 *           GDS's office suburb (it is on their contact page, not something
 *           they promote), "every state" (they say across the country) and
 *           Mantis FPV's delivery offers, which carry conditions a sentence
 *           here would drop: free standard delivery over $150 and express
 *           over $250 excluding bulky items, and same day processing only
 *           for in stock orders before 11 am AEST on weekdays. An offer
 *           goes on a card in the partner's own words, conditions and all,
 *           or not at all.
 *   links   where their card sends people, first link first. `kind` is one of
 *           LINK_KINDS, because the board counts each link as a closed word.
 *   logo    the files under assets/partners/, as paths from the repository
 *           root (see LOGO FILES), and the artwork's width over its height.
 *   mark    how the simulator paints them into a freestyle map: `field` is
 *           the colour of the painted panel the logo sits on, dark for a logo
 *           drawn for dark grounds and cream for one drawn for light ones.
 *
 * LOGO FILES. Two per partner:
 *
 *   colour  the partner's own artwork in their own colours, for their card
 *           and for the paint in the world.
 *   mono    the same mark in one colour, the palette's cream, for the chrome:
 *           the partner row and the small lockups. On F1's own site every
 *           partner mark is one colour and one height; in the world they wear
 *           their livery. That is the rule the plan follows, and it is why
 *           the chrome never introduces a colour the palette does not have.
 *
 * The paths are from the REPOSITORY ROOT, as src/art/wallart-atlas.js names
 * its picture, not from this file: each repository copies the files to the
 * same path under the root it serves, and resolves them against that root.
 * Here that is the page at index.html; on the board it is public/.
 *
 * Where each file came from, and what is not ours about it, is in NOTICE.
 * scripts/partners.js checks every field here against the files, and makes
 * the one colour files that can be made mechanically (npm run gen:partners,
 * npm run lint:partners). Imports nothing, touches no DOM, reads no clock:
 * the board's server and Node's checks import it as it is.
