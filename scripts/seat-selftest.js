 * Two tickets from one pilot on 30 September. bug-ddfe1c6d: "It doesn't
 * remember the camera angle and fov that I set. Always return to default 30
 * degrees uptilt and 85 degrees vertical FOV", and going to the whoop and
 * back dropped the five inch's tune. bug-693b9ed4: tuning the whoop on the
 * Flight controller screen took the five inch's tune away. Every check below
