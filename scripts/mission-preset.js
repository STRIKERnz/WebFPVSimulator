/*
 * mission-preset.js: writes src/trackbuilder/presets5.js, the five inch tracks that ship with the builder.
 *
 * ONE TRACK, FROM A SHORT LIST. The 2026 Australian Drone Nationals qualifying track, the plan Wilf (the 2025
 * National Champion) drew, laid out the way the builder lays a track and not copied out of a picture: every
 * distance below is a whole metre read off the plan's own dimensions, so the numbers can be argued with and the
 * file can be written again. It is here for two reasons. A pilot who wants to practise the lap can open it, fly it
 * and change it, and the builder has to be able to make it, so it is also what TRACK-BUILDER-5IN-PLAN.md's
 * acceptance run builds from an empty canvas and compares itself to (scripts/builder-flow-check.js).
 *
 * THE FRAME. The plan is 40 m by 29 m inside a 5 m grid with its origin at the bottom left. Here every plan metre
 * is a field metre moved five east and five north, so the loop that swings out to the west of the left hand
 * column stays on a 45 by 55 m field with a margin, and the start gate is at (20, 19).
 *
 * WHAT IS ON IT, by the plan's own materials list: seven gates (the start gate, two on the left hand column, one
 * on the right, and the three bays of the wall), nine flags (two on each of the gates on the right and the lower
 * left, one on the upper left, one at the end of the wall, two on the hurdle, and the turn flag), a hurdle and an
 * up gate. The lap goes:
 *
 *   start gate, over the hurdle, a spiral down round the south flag of the gate on the right and through it east,
 *   up through the up gate, round the flag on the wall's east end and through its bays north, south and north,
 *   a spiral down round the north flag of the upper left hand gate and through it east, the swing out west, the
 *   lower left hand gate east, round the turn flag, the lower left hand gate east again, and home.
 *
 * THE FIRST READING WAS WRONG, and the owner said so on 2026-10-01: the two spirals were built as loops out of a
 * gate and back through it, which is two passes, where the plan means a spiral down round the flag on the gate and
 * then one pass; and the wall was flown south, north, south, where it is entered round its flag and flown north,
 * south, north. The upper left hand gate turned round with it: the plan's line crosses it going east, as it does
 * every other gate on the left. The plan draws each gate folded flat towards the side it is flown out of, which
 * is how the faces were read the second time.
 *
 * Every gate on it is 2 m between uprights, which is the bay the plan draws once the world builds a gate fifteen
 * percent larger than the document (GATE_SCALE), so the wall's bays are 2 m apart and its uprights meet. The
 * credit names the designer and the event, and the sponsor's mark is not on it: it is theirs and not ours to
 * ship. The line the plan draws is a suggestion and the plan's spirals are a couple of metres across, so the track
 * holds its curve warning to a metre and not to the 2.5 m a freeform course is held to.
 *
 * Run `node scripts/mission-preset.js` to write the file, and `--check` to fail when the file is not what this
 * would write now.
