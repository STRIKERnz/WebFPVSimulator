/*
 * crash-check.js: fly the real shell into the real town and measure the
 * crash, before the contact solver moves and after it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The owner's report was that crashing in the freestyle city
 * bounces you around, clips you through buildings and sometimes makes you
 * vanish. The review that followed (PROGRESS.md, 2026-09-24) measured it
 * with a scratch probe, and the owner approved moving obstacle contact into
 * the plant on condition that coverage lands first. scripts/plant-golden.js
 * pins the plant. This pins the thing a pilot flies: the shell, Betaflight,
 * the plant and the town's colliders together, through the same guidance law
 * scripts/park-fly.js flies the training park with (scripts/lib/pilot.js).
 *
 * Every scenario is flown at one shopfront beside the spawn street, a face at
 * x = 5.6 whose box runs z 28.17 to 31.03 and up to a roof at 6.76, because
 * it is the densest thing near the spawn and it was measured first. Its
 * numbers are read off window.__colliderBoxes and are checked on every run:
 * if the town moves that wall, the check says so rather than flying at air.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF ASSERTION, and the difference is the point.
 *
 *   GUARDS hold today and must hold after the rewrite. The craft's state
 *   stays finite, its centre never goes inside a solid, it never moves
 *   further in a frame than its own speed allows (a teleport), and every
 *   scenario actually reaches the wall it is named for. A red guard is a
 *   regression, full stop. Since the owner's first flight of the new solver
 *   there is one more: a craft is never left stuck, still and not upright,
 *   for longer than stuckTick allows before it is set down. That set down
 *   is the one sanctioned jump, and it is counted rather than read as a
 *   teleport, because it restarts the sim clock.
 *
 *   TARGETS are the crash the owner asked for, in numbers: a gentle tap
 *   leaves the wall, a fast hit tumbles rather than pinballs, a roof is
 *   ground, full throttle gets you off a wall, and a crash never teleports
 *   the craft. Most of them are red today, which is the review's finding
 *   written as a test. They are always measured and printed; `--targets`
 *   makes them count toward the exit code, which is how the check is run
 *   once the new solver is in. The numbers are the owner's to tune.
 *
 * Not deterministic to the bit, because the pilot runs on the frame clock
 * of a headless browser, so nothing here is compared for equality. Every
 * assertion is an inequality with room for a frame of jitter.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/crash-check.js [--targets] [--only=name] [--json=PATH]
 * Exit code is the number of failed guards, plus failed targets with
 * --targets.
