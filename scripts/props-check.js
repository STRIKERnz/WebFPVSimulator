/*
 * props-check.js: every freestyle asset, proved well formed, deterministic
 * and solid in the real physics module.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A freestyle map is built from src/props, and every asset
 * there is a list of parts that is drawn and solid in one line
 * (src/props/parts.js). What is solid goes to dist/sim.wasm through
 * src/game/plantworld.js and is resolved at 1 kHz by src/native/world.c. So
 * an asset that makes a NaN, an asset that turns a box by 0.4 rad, or a
 * layout that rolls a different ruin on a second load is a wall a quad
 * flies through or a trace that differs between two browsers. None of that
 * shows in a screenshot. This file looks for it in plain Node, in these
 * blocks:
 *
 *   1. assets      every prop type, every style, at its default dims and at
 *                  the min and max of every limit, at six headings: every
 *                  number finite, every part a real box or capsule, no solid
 *                  box on an asset that turns freely, quarter turns that are
 *                  exact permutations to the bit, nothing inflated
 *   1c. on end     the assets that stand on end (containers, the ledge), both
 *                  ways, at the same dims: the same boxes in the same sizes,
 *                  to a nanometre, with the lowest on the ground, the footprint
 *                  centred along the heading, z untouched, and no taller
 *                  than the builder says; and, in the module, a drop onto
 *                  a container stood on its end and onto one half sunk in the
 *                  ground, each landing on the part of it that is above the
 *                  paving, at the height it is
 *   1b. envelope   the same dims, what is solid against what is drawn: no
 *                  solid over the drawn top, the chimney's solids on its
 *                  brick, no stair drawn where the layout built none
 *   1d. fly through the chimney you can fly down and the turbine that
 *                  stands still, on their solids: the bore clear, the
 *                  doorway the width asked for with nothing solid in it, no
 *                  slot between solids, the drawing and the solids agreeing
 *                  to centimetres, the blades 2.5 m off the ground and
 *                  clear of the tower by the gap rule
 *   2. furniture   every course element a freestyle map may hold, the same
 *   3. determinism a map holding one of everything, placed twice from two
 *                  fresh documents, compared as Float64 bits and hashed, and
 *                  src/props/trig.js against the engine's own sine
 *   4. physics     that map uploaded to the module exactly as the shell does
 *                  it, and flown: a roof lands, the crane's mast stops a
 *                  craft, the spawn is clear; a craft dropped down the
 *                  hollow chimney's bore touches nothing and one flown in
 *                  through its doorway reaches the axis, while the wall
 *                  opposite stops it; the turbine's tower and a blade stop
 *                  a craft and the air between two blades does not; and
 *                  under every box thin enough for the height to reach,
 *                  the height answers from under it and a climb meets its
 *                  underside; and the builder's copy of the module's grid
 *                  (fs-crowded) drops what the module drops, and no map
 *                  here is over it
 *   5. starter     the starter map (src/maps/built/starter.js) and the
 *                  showpiece built on it (showpiece.js): no two elements'
 *                  solids overlap, every named gap is clear, the builder
 *                  has nothing to warn about, and the craft takes off from
 *                  the pads, and on the starter from the same pads raised
 *                  onto the office roof, seated where the shell seats it,
 *                  on the map's own ground; and a map with no pads and a
 *                  pylon over the point it starts from, where the start
 *                  is moved into the open and a climb straight up from it
 *                  clears the peak, which a climb from the point does not
 *   6. scene       a map's time of day and ground change paint and light
 *                  and never a solid
 *   7. egg         where the STF mark goes (src/maps/built/egg.js): on a
 *                  drawn wall with open air in front, in no solid, in full
 *                  sight of the pads, turned to them and in reach, no wall
 *                  that scores higher keeping the rules, the same every
 *                  time and whatever the id, on the starter, one of
 *                  everything, fifty random maps and maps built to reach
 *                  the ground fallback; pure, and timed on the starter and
 *                  on ten thousand solids. Then finding it
 *                  (src/game/egg.js), against the starter's real colliders,
 *                  and that nothing the builder loads can draw it
 *
 * WHAT A FAILURE MEANS. The line names the asset, the style, the dimension
 * set and the heading, and the first numbers that are wrong. A threshold
 * here is never widened to make a line pass (CLAUDE.md); the argument goes
 * in PROGRESS.md.
 *
 * The flights reuse scripts/world-check.js's pilot: the same height hold,
 * the same hover throttle, the same forward stick and the same hands off on
 * contact, on the five inch, which is the only craft freestyle is offered
 * on. Every flight is flown twice and must agree with itself to the bit.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/props-check.js [--only=assets|tilt|envelope|flythrough|furniture|determinism|physics|starter|scene|egg] [--verbose]
 *        node scripts/props-check.js --selftest    prove each detector sees a planted fault
 * Exit code is the number of failed checks.

/*
 * WHERE THE STF MARK GOES ON A BUILT MAP (src/maps/built/egg.js). The sim
 * chooses the spot from the map's own assets and nothing a player reads says
 * where, so this is the only place anybody can see that the spot keeps its
 * rules. Since 2026-09-25 the mark is painted to be SEEN from the pads,
 * where Stage B hid it from them: the owner, "the logo of SubTwoFIfty is too
 * hard to find, make it easy to see on any map" (FREESTYLE-MAPS-PLAN.md
 * section 12, decision 10). Each rule is restated here in this file's own
 * geometry, the distances the starter block already trusts, so a mistake in
 * egg.js's arithmetic shows as a spot that breaks one:
 *
 *   1  paint on a wall: the mark is on an upright face of a solid box its
 *      element draws, not glass, 6 by 3 m or down to 0.3 of that, two to
 *      one, and inside the face; a wall's mark is the biggest that fits 10
 *      cm in from its edges and 10 cm over rule 2's 0.3 m
 *   2  open air: the mark pushed out 3 m along its normal is clear of every
 *      solid, over 0.3 m and inside the plot
 *   3  never in a solid: the point 2 cm off the mark's middle is in none
 *   4  seen from the pads: no line from 0.3, 2 and 5 m over the seat to the
 *      mark's middle, corners and edge middles, 5 cm in and ending 2 cm off
 *      the face, passes through a solid a pilot cannot see through: a box
 *      that is not glass, a net, a railing, a balustrade of bars or a
 *      skylight, not foliage, or a capsule 0.3 m thick or more
 *   5  turned to the pads and in reach: the wall's normal, at the middle of
 *      the band a mark can take on it, within 60 degrees of the eye 2 m over
 *      the seat, and the mark's middle 15 to 60 m from the spawn across the
 *      ground
 *   6  the pick: no wall that scores higher (the width of the mark it takes,
 *      times how square it stands to the pads, over its distance, times 2
 *      plus the cosine of the turn from the pads' heading, all at the
 *      wall's middle) keeps rules 1 to 5 at its middle; the score the spot
 *      reports is the one this file computes; the walls come best first;
 *      the same spot on a second run, after normalize(normalize(doc)), and
 *      under another id
 *   7  always a spot: 'ground' only when no wall keeps rules 1 to 5 at its
 *      middle; flat on the paving, 12 by 6 m or the most the plot has room
 *      for, square to the plot and reading away from the pads, at the first
 *      of its places whose air is clear, or the first; each on a map built
 *      to reach it
 *   8  pure and quick: nothing imported but src/props/trig.js, no DOM, no
 *      clock, no Math.random, and the time on the starter and on a map of
 *      ten thousand solids
 *   9  no JS trigonometry or powers anywhere in the file
 *
 * Rule 6 is checked at each wall's middle only. egg.js tries a wall at up to
 * 49 places, and a wall whose middle is blocked can still take the mark to
 * one side; restating that walk would be restating egg.js. What this sees is
 * the failure that matters: a better wall, clear at its middle, passed over.
