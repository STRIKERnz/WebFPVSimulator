/*
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE CHECK FROM shell-check.js.
 *
 * That one measures ONE window, records a per screen overflow budget and
 * fails when a budget grows. It is the right shape for "did this change
 * cost list", and it is blind to the whole class of defect this file is
 * about, because every one of those defects is invisible at 1600 by 900.
 *
 * What was actually found the first time this ran, all of it real:
 *
 *   the Race room's rows sat 8 px off the right of every phone and tablet,
 *   because a stage sized in vw is wider than the padded box holding it;
 *   the help column, the single reason a person can learn an FPV sim here,
 *   was entirely below the fold on a phone on Quad, Pilot and Paused;
 *   the title's row list had no height cap at all on a narrow window, so
 *   Report bug could not be reached by any amount of scrolling;
 *   the pause menu put Quit to title 242 px below a 720 px window with no
 *   scroller, so a pilot who paused a run could not quit it.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, and the one thing it deliberately does not.
 *
 * Reachability, not position. A screen is allowed to put content below the
 * fold as long as a person can scroll to it: the Freestyle room's four
 * world cards do exactly that on a phone and are fine. So every assertion
 * scrolls the thing into view the way a person would, and then asks
 * whether it is visible. Anything still off screen after that is lost.
 *
 * Touch emulation is on, so `pointer: coarse` matches and the 44 px target
 * rule is actually exercised rather than assumed.

/*
 * THE FLIGHT OSD, ON A PHONE HELD SIDEWAYS (POLISH-PLAN.md item 14). With
 * the thumb sticks up the OSD used to stack pack, speed, height, throttle
 * and the Weight slider in one centre column, up to about 270 px of a 390 px
 * screen, and the launch banner landed on the lap clock. Flown three
 * times on each case:
 *
 *   on the pads, with the launch prompt up and the Weight slider out;
 *   in the air, where the slider is gone;
 *   paused, where the Weight is a menu row whose track a thumb can reach,
 *   and the overlay's slider is not drawn through the menu.
 *
 * The cases are the widest lines and the tallest clock. Hibari Yard, the
 * shipped freestyle map, on the five inch, whose right corner carries the
 * speed as well as the height and whose launch prompt has the longest
 * second line; at the survey's phone and at the narrowest one pictured.
 * And a race, through the Race room and the launch card, on the first
 * shipped track, which is a whoop track, so on the whoop as input-check
 * flies it: the lap clock with its gate line under it is the tallest the
 * clock gets before the banner has to hang below it, on the shortest
 * phone pictured.
 *
 * Asserted every time in flight: nothing drawn by the OSD or the banner
 * reaches into the centre third of the picture (the middle third of the
 * width AND of the height, the gate's cell; the target mark is the one
 * thing meant to sit on the gate and is not counted), nothing of the OSD
 * lies on a thumb plate, each corner is one line in its own outer third
 * along the top, the banner hangs below the lap clock, the bug chip and
 * the music dock are away, and Pause is up and takes a touch at its middle:
 * shown on the pads, faded after about three seconds in the air (item 12)
 * and still taking the touch.
